# Pre-Recognition Service

This repository contains two initial tests for using the [face-api](https://justadudewhohacks.github.io/face-api.js/docs/index.html)/[tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [tracking](https://trackingjs.com/) libraries for the development of a facial recognition pre-service for SmartFace.
